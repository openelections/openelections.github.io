## ðŸš€ Development

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.2.8+ (managed with rbenv/RVM recommended)
- Bundler gem

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openelections/openelections.github.io.git
cd openelections.github.io

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Serve locally with live reload
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# Visit http://localhost:4000
```

### Alternative Commands

```bash
# Build for production
bundle exec jekyll build

# Serve on different port
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4001

# Clean build artifacts
bundle exec jekyll clean
```

### NPM Scripts (optional)

```bash
npm run serve    # Same as bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
npm run build    # Same as bundle exec jekyll build  
npm run clean    # Same as bundle exec jekyll clean
```

## Updating metadata

Information about the project status and the availability of downloadable results for individual elections is stored in JSON files in the ``data`` directory.  These files will sometimes need to be updated from data in the [dashboard](https://github.com/openelections/dashboard) and [core](https://github.com/openelections/core) apps.

These tasks can be run either within the environment of these apps, or remotely, using Fabric tasks in the ``openelex-config`` repo.

#### Updating the state status metadata

To update the ``state_status.json`` file, which drives the map and table on the home page and the state status in the sidebar, do one of the following:

From the dashboard app's environment, run:

```
django-admin.py create_status_json > /path/to/data/state_status.json
```

or using Fabric, run:

```
fab -R prod create_status_json:outputfilename=/path/to/data/state_status.json
```

### Updating the election results availability metadata

The election results availability files are stored as ``data/elections-{state_abbrev}.json``.  This data drives the elections visualization and download table for each state.

To generate the election results availability for a state, the data for the elections needs to be loaded into the database.  Then, do one of the following:

From the core app's environment, run:

```
openelex bake.results_status_json --state=WY > /path/to/data/elections-wy.json
```

or using Fabric, run:

```
fab -R prod bake_results_status_json:state=WY,outputfilename=/path/to/data/elections-wy.json
```

In either case, replace "WY" with the abbreviation of the state whose metadata you want to generate.

## Deployment

### Why is this repo named 'openelections.github.io'?

Presently, we use [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) as an inexpensive, easy to deploy, hosting strategy for the website.

Due to the need to host both the API and this website on the openelections.net domain, we proxy requests on our web head to openelections.github.io, the default domain for a GitHub-pages hosted site for an organization.

Naming the repository ``openelections.github.io`` is a convention that causes this site to be hosted at http://openelections.github.io.  It also allows the site to be deployed by pushing to the ``master`` branch on GitHub rather than pushing to the ``gh-pages`` branch.

### Deploying the site

After making any changes to the markdown, template, JavaScript, metadata JSON, etc., testing things out with ``jekyll serve``, commit the changes locally.

Then push the changes to the ``master`` branch of the remote repository on GitHub:

```
git push origin master
```
