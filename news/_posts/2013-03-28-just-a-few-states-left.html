If you are still considering volunteering for OpenElections, we have a few states left to be 'adopted'. We've had a terrific response so far from folks agreeing to contribute and we could really use your help getting these last few states spoken for:</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:small;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:small;"><strong>AL, AK, DE, HI, LA, ME, MI, MS, MT, NV, NH, OK, SC, SD, UT, ID</strong><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:small;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:small;">Working on a state means contacting state and/or local election officials, identifying the best source of archived results since 2000, logging metadata, and helping us assess the format of the results for each year so that we can make a master plan for feeding them all into our system. This is a pretty detailed process, but if you are intrepid at heart, and a data hound, it's a pretty satisfying one. The value of our collective efforts will be huge: a service to journalists and the public at large. You can learn more about the volunteer process <a href="http://blog.openelections.net/2013/03/08/calling-all-election-data-hounds/" target="_blank">here</a>, and the nitty gritty on the meta-data entry <a href="http://blog.openelections.net/getting-involved-the-nitty-gritty/">here</a>.<br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:small;"> </span></div>
<div><strong><span style="font-size:small;">We hope you will join us!</span></strong></div>
