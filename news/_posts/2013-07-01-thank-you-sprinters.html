<p>We had a great turnout last Saturday for our second Metadata Sprint. Joining the OpenElections team based in LA, San Francisco and DC were journalists and developers from Austin, Boulder, Chicago, DC, and Madison.</p>
<p>Between<strong> 8 of us, we entered 120 elections into our system, </strong>significantly closing the gap on our metadata gathering progress. In fact we now have <strong>only</strong> <strong>four states left to be adopted - LA, MS, SD, and UT. </strong>More on joining in <a href="http://blog.openelections.net/2013/03/08/calling-all-election-data-hounds/">here</a>.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Our sprint winner this time was Texas Tribune software engineer <strong>Chris Chang</strong>.</p>
