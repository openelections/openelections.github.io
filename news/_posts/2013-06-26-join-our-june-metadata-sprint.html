<p>We got some great momentum going for our content entry process with the last Metadata Sprint in April. To keep things moving at a good pace, we are having another sprint this Saturday and would like to invite you to (virtually) attend. If you are not already volunteering for us, this is your chance! We have a few states still available...</p>
<p><strong>AK, DE, ID, LA, MS, MT, OK, SC, SD, UT</strong></p>

The Sprint:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saturday June 29<br />
10am - 1pm PDT/1pm - 4pm EST</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Join us via Google Hangout to enjoy the encouragement and ongoing banter of our team and your fabulous co-volunteers from around the country as we keep this data transparency effort going one data point at a time. Complimentary coffee will be served (via online Starbucks certificates), and there will be <strong>OpenElections t-shirts</strong> for anyone who enters 10 races into our system, plus a mystery prize (and worldwide recognition via our blog) for the person who enters the most races during the sprint.</p>
