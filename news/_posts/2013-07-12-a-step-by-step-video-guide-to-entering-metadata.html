<p>For those volunteers who might like a bit more clarification before digging into the Metadata entry process, or for those who would like a refresher to be sure they are entering election results correctly, we have created a <strong><a href="http://docs.openelections.net/metadata-screencast/" target="_blank">screencast</a></strong> <strong>to walk you through the process</strong>. You will see examples of more straightforward and more idiosyncratic state board of elections web sites and pointers for how you can identify the relevant information for each. You will also see an explanation of our project admin system, what information we are looking for, and how you can verify information about an election.</p>
<p><strong>If you still have questions</strong>, don't hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:openelections@gmail.com">openelections@gmail.com</a> or ask them on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openelections" target="_blank">Google Group</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you'd like to join</strong> <strong>us</strong> and volunteer, we have <strong>2 states left to be adopted: SD and UT</strong>. Learn more about volunteering <a href="http://blog.openelections.net/2013/03/08/calling-all-election-data-hounds/">here</a>!</p>
