<p>A few weeks ago, we began requesting precinct-level election results from counties in Oregon. The Secretary of State maintains county-level results, <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionhistory.aspx">typically in electronic PDFs</a>, so to get down to precinct level we need to ask <a href="http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/countyofficials.aspx">county clerks across the state</a>. Many of them post precinct results on their sites, but some don't, so we emailed a few to ask for results from 2000-2014. In doing so, we were prepared to pay reasonable fees for them, as the <a href="http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/192.440">Oregon Revised Statutes</a> permit.</p>
<p>Local officials were quick to get back to us in every case, and their responses were straightforward. Here's an example, from Art Harvey, the Josephine County clerk and recorder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The reports you are interested in are available in PDF format.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The cost would be $10.00 per election.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other counties charged fees ranging from $25 (Umatilla County) to $45 (Wasco County) to $86.50 (Linn County, which sent us <a href="https://twitter.com/openelex/status/609787926789144576">paper print-outs</a> of election results that we'll be scanning). And then there's Tillamook County, where Tassi O'Neil, the county clerk there, has set a price of $664 for PDF copies of precinct-level results for elections from 2000-2014.</p>
<p>We wondered how that price was calculated, so we asked. Ms. O'Neil responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fee for each election is $3.75 locate fee and then .25 cents per page.  That is the fee if it is a paper copy or if we send it in a PDF.  That is the charge that the Oregon Revised Statues say that we can/or should charge.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is true, but there are two points here: One is that members of the public are being charged for pages of an <em>electronic </em>document. There are no paper copies involved here. The other is that the <a href="http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/192.440">Oregon Revised Statutes</a> also say this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The custodian of any public record may furnish copies without charge or at a substantially reduced fee if the custodian determines that the waiver or reduction of fees is in the public interest because making the record available primarily benefits the general public.</p></blockquote>
<p>As OpenElections is a non-profit effort dedicated to publishing machine-readable election results that can be freely used by anyone, we're pretty sure that our project primarily benefits the general public. We've asked for such a waiver or reduction of the $664 and are awaiting a reply. Oregon law also permits us to appeal a denial of a fee waiver or reduction to the Attorney General, and we will be pursuing that option should it become necessary.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we've been <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-or">converting Oregon PDF results to CSVs</a> and will continue to do so. There are plenty of ways for you to <a href="https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-or/issues">contribute to that effort</a>, and we welcome any suggestions or advice on our dealings with Oregon officials.</p>
