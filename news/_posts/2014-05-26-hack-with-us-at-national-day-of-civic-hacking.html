<p><strong>As part of <a href="http://hackforchange.org/" target="_blank">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>, we are organizing an OpenElections <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-6YueYq-FiPqiXLIzKtlCcvs_DwxzKZJ-XtYowBEKoc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">challenge</a> for the <a href="http://hackforchange.org/events/" target="_blank">hacking events</a> at locations all over the country - Sat May 31 and Sun June 1st.</strong></p>
<p>If you are attending one of these events near you, and would like to join in on our effort to write scrapers for elections results, let us know!</p>
<p><strong>Write Scrapers for us...</strong><br />
Help us extend our core scraper architecture to create a series of custom scrapers that account for the idiosyncrasies in how each state structures data, stores it, and makes it available.</p>
<p><em>**Our docs for this process are now up on our site. Look <a style="color:#d6223a;" href="http://docs.openelections.net/guide/">here</a> to see what would be involved with joining in**</em></p>
<p>Your time and expertise would be most appreciated either day. Also, feel free to join in from home.</p>
<p>If you would like to help out, email <a href="mailto:sschnadt.projects@gmail.com" target="_blank">sschnadt.projects@gmail.com</a> either or tweet at us <a href="https://twitter.com/openelex" target="_blank">@OpenElex</a> either before the event or on the day. Our team will be online and available to get you set up.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>The OpenElections Team</p>
