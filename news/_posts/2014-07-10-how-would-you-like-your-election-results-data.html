<p>As we get the first few states' data processed and ready to release, we are building an interface to deliver it to you, and to show our progress as we go. The live site (above) now shows metadata work to date, and the volunteers involved. Soon you will be able to toggle between this view and a map of the current condition of results data (below). Clicking on each state will show you details on the most cleaned version of available data.</p>
<p><a href="http://openelections.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-09-at-12-37-32-pm1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1169 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2014-07-09-at-12-37-32-pm1.png?w=580" alt="Data Map" width="580" height="339" /></a></p>
<p>The color coding on this new map will change as we get more states online with 'raw' results, and fully cleaned data (what you see here is hypothetical and just to illustrate how the map will work). When we say ‘raw’, we really mean results that reflect the data provided by state elections officials. These results are only available at the reporting levels provided by the states and fields like party and candidate names have not been standardized.  These results do have standardized field names, so you will be able to more easily load and analyze the data across states. We will get as many states fully cleaned as we can, but our baseline goal for this year is to wire up and make available most of the data in a 'raw' state.</p>
<p><strong>As we build the data interface, we would love to know what you think. Is the terminology we are using clear to you? Is the interaction clear? Is there anything else you would like to see here?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://openelections.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen-shot-2014-07-09-at-1-30-58-pm.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1174 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screen-shot-2014-07-09-at-1-30-58-pm.png?w=580" alt="Download Page" width="580" height="385" /></a></p>
<p>If you click on the 'Detailed Data' link on the data map page, you will get to this download page showing all the races for the state you have chosen. You can download results at a variety of reporting levels, depending on what is available for this state. We will include rows in this view for all processed data (clean and raw) as well as any races we haven't processed yet, just so that you know they exist.</p>
<p>Above the download table there is a slider that both gives you an overview of all the races available for a state, and a way to select just a specific date range for which to browse detailed results. You can filter results by race type - such as President, Governor, State Legislative races, etc.. If there are any other ways that you need to access the data, or if anything about this interface could be clearer, please let us know!</p>
<p><strong><br />
We will be building out a preliminary version of this interface in the next couple of weeks, and will revise it further based on what we hear from you.  </strong></p>
