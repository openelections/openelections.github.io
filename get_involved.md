With a network of volunteers, we will be creating the first ever comprehensive and free resource that gives journalists and the public access to historical election results for federal and state-wide races.

For this effort, we are looking for volunteers to help identify and format results data in each state, people with programming skills and also people who are intrepid researchers and lovers of data. [Follow us](http://twitter.com/openelex) on Twitter for updates, or join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openelections) or email us at [openelections@gmail.com](mailto:openelections@gmail.com) to let us know you’d like to pitch in and adopt a state as a data gatherer or a more technical data wrangler. We are also [posting our code](https://github.com/openelections) on Github.
